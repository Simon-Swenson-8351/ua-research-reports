Presentation Notes

S3: Explain the joke, but don't belittle physicsts.
    -If even physicists simplify their models, we should be justified in 
    simplifying ours.
S10: Mention that your goal with going over related work is not to explain how they 
    work, but just what their results are.
S17: "fracture events in time" is yellow because change will be detected oncce a 
    fracture event starts, but the actual, individual binary fractures are not 
    identified once this wave of fracture starts.
S18-S19 Transition: Mention how object-based approaches overcome one of the 
    shortcomings of voxel-based by identifying and differentiating individual 
    objects
S21: Same reason as in S17 above
S21-S22 Transition: Mention how the object-based methods previously 
    mentioned were concerned with long-term change, i.e., images before and 
    after a scene has changed. However, there is work that reasons about 
    individual objects over video sequences, like what we're trying to do.
S35: Mention why every node on the left-hand side needs to go to each Im node
    -Times are in terms of fracture offsets, so, to find the absolute time 
    necessary to generate the image (\Delta t^c \times m) Need to add up all 
    T_i to reason about which fragments are visible at each image capture time.
