n08         f.  Limitations
                i.  Not reversible
                ii. No guarantee of how *good* of an optimum will result
                iii.The process must be restarted to arrive at a different optimum.

    II. Parallel Tempering
n09     1.  General idea: parallelize simulated annealing w/ multiple chains at 
            different temperatures
f03     2.  figure
n09         (note how high temperature chains exist throughout the process. 
            solves restart-for-other-optima problem of simulated annealing)

r06     4.  (quick) application to traveling salesman
        5.  when/how to swap?
            a.  choosing which chains to swap
                i.  uniform random
r05             ii. stochastic even-odd
r04         b.  determining whether the swap is successful
            c.  caveat: the choice of swapping affects whether the chain is 
                reversible! (more in a bit)
n09             (solves problem of simulated annealing not being reversible)
        6.  choosing temperatures for the multiple chains
r04         a.  histograms require overlap
            b.  Temperature difference should be exponential
            c.  Experimental and theoretical results show that 20-24% acceptance 
                ratio of swaps is ideal.
